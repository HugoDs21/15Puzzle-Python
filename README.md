# Problem 
The game of 15 is represented by a 4x4 matrix where there are 15 numbered cells and a white cell.

## Solving Idea
To solve this problem we used a few searching algorithms such as 
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Iterative Depth-First Search (IDFS)
- "A star" (A*)
- Greedy
